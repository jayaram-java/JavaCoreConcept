// Relationship = Composition represents a "has-a" relationship(Car has an engine).
// Inheritance represents an "Is-a" relationship(Dog is an animal).

// Composition provides more flexibility in modifying or replacing components.
// Inheritance binds classes more tightly, and changes in the base class can affect all derived classes.
